Here we are talking about how to insert a html file in your post in Jekyll! 

For example, we need to insert crossword.html (the crossword below).

First, we put the html file in the /_includes folder. 

Then we create a post and include the following line in that post.

Finally, we are done!

{% include crosswords.html %}
