I am a senior undergraduate at Yao Class 92,  Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. 

I have a strong interest in the foundations of machine learning (e.g. generalizability, robustness, explainability). Specifically, I have been focusing on multi-modal learning. In addition, I am also curious about cognitive science, especially language understanding and human vision perception. I dream of building a unified framework for intelligence from an interdisciplinary perspective -- mathematics, psychology, computer science and so on.

In my spare time, I am an enthusiastic explorer and a dedicated volunteer.

My github repo is [here](https://github.com/lst627).
