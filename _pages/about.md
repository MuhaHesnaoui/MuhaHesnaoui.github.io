I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/). Previously, I graduated from Yao class, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. 

I have a strong interest in the foundations of machine learning (e.g. generalization and robustness). Specifically, I have been focusing on the theory and practice of multi-modal learning. Previously, I worked on causal theory for model explainability. 

In addition, I am also curious about cognitive science, especially language understanding and human vision perception. I dream of building a unified framework for intelligence from an interdisciplinary perspective -- mathematics, psychology, computer science and so on.

In my spare time, I am an enthusiastic explorer and a dedicated volunteer.
