Welcome to my personal website!

I am a senior undergraduate studying in Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. 

I have a strong interest in robustness and interpretability of neural networks and multimodal learning (both theory and practice). I am also curious about cognitive science, especially human vision perception. My dream is to build a unified framework for intelligence.

My github repo is [here](https://github.com/lst627).
